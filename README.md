# Customer Clustering for Travel Agency Customers

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a customer clustering approach to segment travel agency customers based on their behaviors and demographics. Clustering helps identify distinct customer groups, enabling tailored marketing strategies and improved customer engagement.

## Project Overview

The `Customer_Clustering_for_Travel_Agency_Customers.ipynb` notebook focuses on using clustering techniques to segment customers for a travel agency. By identifying unique clusters, the agency can personalize offerings, create targeted campaigns, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Objectives
- Segment customers based on key behavioral and demographic features.
- Analyze each segment for unique characteristics and insights.
- Provide actionable recommendations for data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies the most relevant features for clustering (e.g., spending patterns, travel frequency).
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implements clustering techniques such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses cluster quality using metrics like the Silhouette Score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes customer clusters to understand segment characteristics clearly.
